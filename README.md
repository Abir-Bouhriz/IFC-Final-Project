# IFC-Final-Project
This repository is a challenge from IFC.js crash course which I applied the knowledge and skills I have gained throughout the course to create a web application using IFC.js and Three.js. The goal of this project is to build a simple interactive viewer for IFC files that allows users to visualize and explore 3D building models in a web browser.

## Tools & languages:

* Visual Studio Code (IDE)
* Web-ifc-three
* Three.js
* Mapbox GL JS
* HTML & CSS

## Getting Started
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Abir-Bouhriz/IFC-Final-Project.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:5500/index.html 

## Features
Once you have the project running, you can explore the gallery & the BIM tools :

* Selection: By clicking on the model's elements, you can select them.
* Labeling: By double clicking on any element, you can draw annotations on top of it.
* Map: You can explore your model in a minimap from Mapbox.
* Spatial tree: You can get the spatial tree structure of the project.
* Hiding: You can hide and isolate model's elements.
* Export: You can export the model with custom name as an ifc file.
